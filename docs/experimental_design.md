# Experimental Design
"Performance often depends upon more than one factor such as the system and the workload. Proper analysis requires that the effects of each factor be isolated from those of others so that meaningful statements can be made about different levels of the factor, for instance, different systems." [Jain, The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis]
## Factors
We can differentiate between common factors, that apply to all experiments and between specific factors that only apply to a certain group of blockchain technologies or in some cases only to a single blockchain.

### Common Factors

 See [```src/example_configs/explanation.json```](../src/evaluation/explanation.json) for the parameters and explanation

### Specific Factors

For specific parameters see the example config files
